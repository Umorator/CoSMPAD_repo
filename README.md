Written by Rafael Moran - 2023

About
CoSMPAD encompasses more than 20 types of experimental information previously reported for 50 proteins that were secreted using different signal peptides. CoSMPAD aims to serve as a reference for the recombinant protein research community, and can also be used to make predictive models by analysing the impact of different determinants on the expression of secreted proteins. sd
